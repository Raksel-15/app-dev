## My Favorite Series/Movies
**Favorite Series**
### Breaking Bad
I love _Breaking Bad_, a masterful blend of drama, action, and thriller that has rightfully earned its reputation as one of the greatest TV series of all time. While I was initially drawn to it by the immense hype and glowing reviews, what truly hooked me was the impeccable pacing, compelling character introductions, and intricate, gripping plot. Walter White, or Heisenberg, stands out as my favorite character, thanks to his extraordinary transformation from a humble teacher to a menacing drug kingpin—a journey that’s brilliantly written and executed. Every episode kept me fully immersed, with even the seemingly odd ones like the "bug episode" being a solid 10/10 in my book. While I can’t say I connected with any deep themes or messages, I thoroughly enjoyed the exceptional storytelling, strong acting, and satisfying ending.

**Favorite Movie**
### Fury
The movie Fury, a gripping war-action film, captured my attention thanks to its intense scenes and compelling plot. I came across it from TikTok and other clips like the iconic Neil deGrasse Tyson meme transitioning to a tank being shot at, caught my curiosity. Bible, one of the characters in the movie, became my favorite—there’s just something about the way he yells "On the way!" before firing the tank that adds an extra layer of intensity. Plus, his religious undertone makes him a unique presence in the crew. Watching Fury was an exhilarating experience; I was captivated throughout, especially during the Tiger vs. Sherman tank battle, which kept me on the edge of my seat. The ending, however, struck something emotional, leaving a lasting impression. While the movie didn’t drastically change my perspective, its action-packed sequences and solid plot make it unforgettable.
