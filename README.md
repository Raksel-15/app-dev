**My Favorite Series/Movies**
## Favorite Series
### Breaking Bad
I am an avid fan of _Breaking Bad_, the thrilling blend of drama, action, and thriller that has rightly won its status as one of, if not, the best TV shows ever made. Initially, I chose it because of the hype and the massive rave reviews it had; eventually, I got hooked on the series' good pacing, engaging character build-up, and complexly constructed gripping plots. The character I liked best from the show is Walter White or Heisenberg: he undergoes a transformation from a lowly teacher to a menacing drug kingpin—a well-written and executed journey. Each episode grabbed me completely; even the infamously low-rated ones like the **"bug episode"** became a solid 10/10 on my scale. Although it is not possible to say that I was touched by the really deep themes and messages, I loved the narration, powerful acting, and a satisfying ending. 10/10, would recommend.

## Favorite Movie
### Fury
On the movie side, I am also a fan of the movie, Fury, a gripping war-action film. Thanks to its intense scenes and compelling plot, this has become one of my favorites. I came across it from TikTok and other clips like the iconic Neil deGrasse Tyson meme, where he demonstrated a flyby sound and then transitioned to a tank being shot, from the movie. These caught my curiosity. When it comes to the characters, Bible became my favorite. There’s just something about the way he yells "On the way!" before firing the tank. Plus, his religiousness makes him a unique presence in the crew. Watching Fury was a great experience I was captivated throughout, especially during the Tiger vs. Sherman tank battle, which kept me at the edge of my seat.  However, the near end of the movie struck something emotional in me. While the movie didn’t drastically change my perspective, its action-packed sequences and solid plot make it unforgettable.
